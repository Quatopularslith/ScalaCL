# ScalaCL
 * Download leiningen from here http://leiningen.org/ first and make sure it is in your path
 * To compile .clj files, run cl-combile.[bat/sh] and then run the scala project normally. The clj files are compiled
into a .jar and then treated as an sbt lib
  * This needs to be done only if a clj file is edited
 * Recomended Intellij Plugin: La clojure. Cursive requires a license to use
